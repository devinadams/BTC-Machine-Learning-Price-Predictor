# BTC Future Price Predictor
This script uses linear regression and machine learning to predict the future price of bitcoins.


This script uses quandl to download the dataframe.

The datasets used currently are blockchain and coinbase

This script uses sklearn, numpy, pandas, quandl, and matplotlib

I recommend you use Anaconda to run this. 

Make sure you insert your own API key from quandl, or the scripts will not be able to grab the datasets.
