# BTC-Machine-Learning-Price-Predictor
Python Linear Regression Machine Learning BTC Price Predictor


Predicts the future price of BTC one day into the future using quandl.

The dataset I used was coinbase's price indexes

This script uses sklearn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib

I recommend you use Anaconda to run this. 

I am still working on having it concatenate each itteration it trains cumulatively when the program runs again.
