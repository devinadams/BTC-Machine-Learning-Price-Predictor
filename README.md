# BTC Future Price Predictor
This script uses linear regression and machine learning to attempt to predict the future price of bitcoins.


This script uses quandl to download various dataframes based on the script.

The datasets used currently are blockchain and coinbase

This script uses sklearn, numpy, pandas, quandl, and matplotlib

I recommend you use Anaconda to run this. 

The most updated script versions are the Py3 versions which do not currently support plotting 

Make sure you insert your own API key from quandl, or the scripts will not be able to grab the datasets.

In the code where it says "YOUR AUTH TOKEN HERE" change this to your Quandl.com API key


Example of plot, zoomed in from previous versions:
