# BTC Future Price Predictor
This script uses linear regression and machine learning to predict the future price of bitcoins.


This script uses quandl to download the dataframe.

The dataset/frame I used was coinbase's price indexes

This script uses sklearn, numpy, pandas, quandl, and matplotlib

I recommend you use Anaconda to run this. 

I am still working on having it concatenate each itteration it trains cumulatively when the program runs again.
